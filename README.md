API Reports 4J
==============

This is a repository with machine-readable JSON-format backward compatibility analysis reports for hundreds of Java libraries. The reports are generated by the Java Upstream Tracker project (https://github.com/lvc/upstream-tracker-4j).

Original detailed HTML-format reports are available here: https://abi-laboratory.pro/java/tracker/

The reports in this repository can be used or redistributed under the terms of the CC-BY-4.0 license.

The repository is AUTO updated three times a week (Mon, Wed, Fri approx. at 11:00 UTC) after each run of the Java Upstream Tracker.

Report Details
--------------

The version of the library can be considered incompatible if: `BC!=100%` or `Removed!=0` or `ArchivesRemoved!=0`

If `BC==100%` then non-zero value of `TotalProblems` indicates minor compatibility warnings.
