API Reports 4J
==============

  This is a repository with machine-readable JSON-format backward compatibility analysis reports for hundreds of Java libraries. The reports are generated by the Java Upstream Tracker project (https://github.com/lvc/upstream-tracker-4j).
  
  Original detailed HTML-format reports are available here: https://abi-laboratory.pro/java/tracker/
  
  The data in this repository may be redistributed under the terms of the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license.
  
  The repository is AUTO updated three times a week (Mon, Wed, Fri approx. at 11:00 UTC) after each run of the Upstream Tracker.

REPORT DETAILS:

  "Version":         Analyzed version of the library
  "From":            Reference version of the library
  "BC":              Avg. backward binary compatibility rate in percents
  "Added":           The number of added methods
  "Removed":         The number of removed methods
  "TotalProblems":   Total number of backward binary compatibility problems (including warnings)
  "ArchivesAdded":   The number of added archives
  "ArchivesRemoved": The number of removed archives
  "TotalArchives":   Total archives checked

  "Src_BC":            Avg. backward source compatibility rate in percents
  "Src_TotalProblems": Total number of backward source compatibility problems (including warnings)

   The version of the library can be considered incompatible if: BC!=100% or Removed!=0 or ArchivesRemoved!=0

   If BC==100% then non-zero value of TotalProblems indicates minor compatibility warnings.
